# Predicting mTOR Chemical Inhibitors - Drug Discovery

The main purpose of the project was to use the chembl databas, focusing on IC50 bioactivity, to ascertain whether a given molecule effectively inhibits the mTOR complex. Using the Chembl database, a list of compounds interacting with mTOR was curated and their stuctures were translated into chemical descriptors encompassing both Lipinski and Mordred descriptors. A machine learning pipeline was developed to predict the inhibitory effect of a certain compound on the mTOR complex. With LazyPredict, the most accurate machine learning model was obtrained and was futher optimized to provide a testabe framework for drug discovery.
